Walking Trajectory Design of Hydraulic Legged Robot with Limited Powered Pump,"A hydraulic drive system can generate a large force and is impact resistant. Thus, robots that utilize hydraulic drive systems have been developed for use in disaster areas. In a hydraulic drive system, it is necessary to design the motion of the robot within the capacity of the pump unit, but it is generally difficult to predict the required flow rate and pressure. Especially for hydraulically driven legged robots, the periodic significant changes in the required flow rate and pressure can make it difficult to select a pump and design the leg operation within pump capacity. Therefore, most operations are not designed in full consideration of the characteristics of the pump. By designing the operation of the robot considering the characteristics of the pump, improvements in energy efficiency and working speed can be expected. In this study, we theoretically derive the relationship between the leg motion of the hydraulic leg robot and the required pressure and flow rate. Based on the results, a method for designing the operation considering the characteristics of the pump is proposed, and its validity is experimentally confirmed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561988/
Automatic Gait Pattern Selection for Legged Robots,"An important issue when synthesizing legged locomotion plans is the combinatorial complexity that arises from gait pattern selection. Though it can be defined manually, the gait pattern plays an important role in the feasibility and optimality of a motion with respect to a task. Replacing human intuition with an automatic and efficient approach for gait pattern selection would allow for more autonomous robots, responsive to task and environment changes. To this end, we propose the idea of building a map from task to gait pattern selection for given environment and performance objective. Indeed, we show that for a 2D half-cheetah model and a quadruped robot, a direct mapping between a given task and an optimal gait pattern can be established. We use supervised learning to capture the structure of this map in a form of gait regions. Furthermore, we propose to construct a warm-starting trajectory for each gait region. We empirically show that these warm-starting trajectories improve the convergence speed of our trajectory optimization problem up to 60 times when compared with random initial guesses. Finally, we conduct experimental trials on the ANYmal robot to validate our method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9340789/
Detecting Usable Planar Regions for Legged Robot Locomotion,"Awareness of the environment is essential for mobile robots. Perception for legged robots requires high levels of reliability and accuracy in order to walk stably in the types of complex, cluttered environments we are interested in. In this paper, we present a usable environmental perception algorithm designed to detect steppable areas and obstacles for the autonomous generation of desired footholds for legged robots. To produce an efficient representation of the environment, the proposed perception algorithm is desired to cluster point cloud data to planar regions composed of convex polygons. We describe in this paper the end-to-end pipeline from data collection to generation of the regions, where we first compose an octree in order to create a more efficient data representation. We then group the leaves in the tree using a nearest neighbor search into a planar region, which is composed of the concave hull of points that is decomposed into convex polygons. We present a variety of environments, and illustrate the usability of this approach by the Atlas humanoid robots walking over rough terrain. We also discuss various challenges we faced and insights we gained in the development of this approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341000/
Wheel-Legged Robotic Limb to Assist Human with Load Carriage: An Application for  Environmental Disinfection During COVID-19,"During COVID-19, with a heavy sprayer filled with disinfectant, the risk of infection for epidemic prevention personnel has been increased by long-term environmental disinfection. In order to reduce the burden and save energy of human, this letter proposed a Wheel-Legged Robotic Limb (WRL) for the carriers. The mass of WRL is only 1.77 kg. The WRL has one rigid robotic limb located below the sprayer, which can provide active supporting force for the sprayer. The WRL adopts force closed-loop control method to ensure the system provide an expected supporting force. The system performance was evaluated including standing and walking at 5 km/h, under three experimental conditions included: 1) with a sprayer, 19.41 kg (SPRAYER), 2) with the powered WRL, 22.18 kg (WRL_ON), and 3) with the unpowered WRL, 22.18 kg (WRL_OFF). When the supporting force is set as 80 N, the experimental results show that the WRL_ON condition has reduced the vertical load force on the human, the vertical ground reaction force of human feet, and the metabolic power by 41.28%, 8.03%, and 17.46% during standing, and also reduced by 32.29%, 8.08% and 18.92% during walking, compared to SPRAYERcondition, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376605/
A Novel Model Predictive Control Framework Using Dynamic Model Decomposition Applied to  Dynamic Legged Locomotion,"Dynamic locomotion for legged robots is difficult because the system dynamics are highly nonlinear and complex, nominally underactuated and unstable, multi-input and multi-output, as well as time-variant and hybrid. One usually faces the choice between the intricate full-body dynamics which remains computationally expensive and sometimes even intractable, and the empirically simplified model which inevitably limits the locomotion capability. In this paper, we explore the legged robot dynamics from a different perspective. By decomposing the robot into the body and the legs, with interaction forces and moments connecting them, we enjoy a novel method called Dynamic Model Decomposition that involves lower-dimensional dynamics for each subsystem while their composition maintaining the equivalence to the original full-order robot model. Based on that, we further propose a corresponding model predictive control framework via quadratic programming, which con-siders linearly approximated body dynamics with constrained leg reaction forces as inputs. The overall methodology was successfully applied to a planar five-link biped robot. The simulation results show that the robot is capable of body reference tracking, push recovery, velocity tracking, and even blind locomotion on fairly rough terrain. This suggests a promising dynamic motion control scheme in the future.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561499/
the Soft-Landing Problem: Minimizing Energy Loss by a Legged Robot Impacting Yielding Terrain,"Enabling robots to walk and run on yielding terrain is vital to endeavors ranging from disaster response to extraterrestrial exploration. While dynamic legged locomotion on rigid ground is challenging enough, yielding terrain presents additional challenges such as ground deformation which dissipates energy. In this paper, we examine the soft-landing problem: given some impact momentum, bring the robot to rest while minimizing foot penetration depth. To gain insight into properties of penetration depth-minimizing control policies, we formulate a constrained optimal control problem and obtain a bang-bang open-loop force profile. Motivated by examples from biology and recent advances in legged robotics, we also examine impedance-control solutions to the soft-landing problem. Through simulations and experiments, we find that optimal impedance reduces penetration depth nearly as much as the open-loop force profile, while remaining robust to model uncertainty. Lastly, we discuss the relevance of this work to minimum-cost-of-transport locomotion for several actuator design choices.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9018262/
Energy Efficient Navigation for Running Legged Robots,"Energy-efficient navigation is an important technology for mobile robots because of its potential to increase the operation time of the robot. In particular, when coupled with a dynamic legged quadruped, the need for energy savings is made more apparent as payloads are limited. Due to the complexity in modeling motion and power models of these robots, a new approach is necessary to effectively motion plan for these complex robots. We accomplish this by using Sampling-Based Model Predictive optimization (SBMPO) which was extended for use on the LLAMA quadrupedal platform in simulation. SBMPO allows for direct generation of trajectories while using a heuristic-based search to speed up computations. This approach is shown to effectively motion plan while optimizing for energy consumption and maintaining the natural dynamics of the robot in a simulated environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8793599/
Optimal Estimation of the Centroidal Dynamics of Legged Robots,"Estimating the centroidal dynamics of legged robots is crucial in the context of multi-contact locomotion of legged robots. In this paper, we formulate the estimation of centroidal dynamics as a maximum a posteriori problem and we use a differential dynamic programming approach for solving it. The soundness of the proposed approach is first validated on a simulated humanoid robot, where ground truth data is available, enabling error analysis, and then compared to other alternatives of the state of the art, namely an extend Kalman filter and a recursive complementary filter. The results demonstrate that, compared to other approaches, the proposed method reduces the estimation error on the centroidal state in addition to ensuring the dynamics consistency of the state trajectory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated on real measurements, obtained from walking experiments with the HRP-2 humanoid robot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561993/
Optimization-Inspired Controller Design for Transient Legged Locomotion,"For robots to leave the safety of the laboratory and explore the world, maneuverability will need to be mastered. However, transient motions, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, have received little attention in the literature. This is mainly due to the complexity of analyzing these high dimensional systems that have no closed-form solution which makes controller design a non-trivial task. One method is to utilize heuristic control inspired by animal locomotion (or intuition), but these may not be optimal for a given task. Here, we take the novel approach and leverage trajectory optimization methods to enable us to identify heuristic controllers for the task of transient locomotion. Specifically, we investigate acceleration to a steady-state gait as well as decelerating from a steady-state gait to rest. These identified heuristic controllers were then validated on a hybrid pneumatic-electric monopod robot. Our initial results indicate that a Raibert controller is in fact the energy optimal policy for transient maneuvers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560759/
Online Gait Transitions and Disturbance Recovery for Legged Robots via the Feasible Impulse Set,"Gaits in legged robots are often hand tuned and time based, either explicitly or through an internal clock, for instance, in the form of central pattern generators. This strategy requires trial and error to identify leg timings, which may not be suitable in challenging terrains. In this letter, we introduce new concepts to quantify leg capabilities for online gait emergence and adaptation, without fixed timings or predefined foothold sequences. Specifically, we introduce the Feasible Impulse Set, a notion that extends aspects of the classical wrench cone to include a prediction horizon into the future. By considering the impulses that can be delivered by the legs, quantified notions of leg utility are proposed for coordinating adaptive lift-off and touch-down of stance legs. The proposed methods provide push recovery and emergent gait transitions with speed. These advances are validated in experiments with the MIT Cheetah 3 robot, where the framework is shown to automatically coordinate aperiodic behaviors on a partially moving walkway.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8630416/
Planning in Learned Latent Action Spaces for Generalizable Legged Locomotion,"Hierarchical learning has been successful at learning generalizable locomotion skills on walking robots in a sample-efficient manner. However, the low-dimensional “latent” action used to communicate between two layers of the hierarchy is typically user-designed. In this letter, we present a fully-learned hierarchical framework, that is capable of jointly learning the low-level controller and the high-level latent action space. Once this latent space is learned, we plan over continuous latent actions in a model-predictive control fashion, using a learned high-level dynamics model. This framework generalizes to multiple robots, and we present results on a Daisy hexapod simulation, A1 quadruped simulation, and Daisy robot hardware. We compare a range of learned hierarchical approaches from literature, and show that our framework outperforms baselines on multiple tasks and two simulations. In addition to learning approaches, we also compare to inverse-kinematics (IK) acting on desired robot motion, and show that our fully-learned framework outperforms IK in adverse settings on both A1 and Daisy simulations. On hardware, we show the Daisy hexapod achieve multiple locomotion tasks, in an unstructured outdoor setting, with only 2000 hardware samples, reinforcing the robustness and sample-efficiency of our approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9363629/
Variable Configuration Planner for Legged-Rolling Obstacle Negotiation Locomotion: Application on the CENTAURO Robot,"Hybrid legged-wheeled robots are able to adapt their leg configuration and height to vary their footprint polygons and go over obstacles or traverse narrow spaces. In this paper, we present a variable configuration wheeled motion planner based on the A* algorithm. It takes advantage of the agility of hybrid wheeled-legged robots and plans paths over low-lying obstacles and in narrow spaces. By imposing a symmetry on the robot polygon, the computed plans lie in a low-dimensional search space that provides the robot with configurations to safely negotiate obstacles by expanding or shrinking its footprint polygon. The introduced autonomous planner is demonstrated using simulations and real-world experiments with the CENTAURO robot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8968014/
Agile Legged-Wheeled Reconfigurable Navigation Planner Applied on the CENTAURO Robot,"Hybrid legged-wheeled robots such as the CEN-TAURO, are capable of varying their footprint polygon to carry out various agile motions. This property can be advantageous for wheeled-only planning in cluttered spaces, which is our focus. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm that builds upon our previously introduced preliminary footprint varying A* planner, which was based on the rectangular symmetry of the foot support polygon. In particular, we introduce a Theta* based planner with trapezium-like search, which aims to further reduce the limitations imposed upon the wheeled-only navigation of the CENTAURO robot by the low-dimensional search space, maintaining the real-time computational efficiency. The method is tested on the simulated and real full-size CENTAURO robot in cluttered environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9197407/
Zero-Shot Imitation Learning from Demonstrations for Legged Robot Visual Navigation,"Imitation learning is a popular approach for training effective visual navigation policies. However, collecting expert demonstrations for legged robots is challenging as these robots can be hard to control, move slowly, and cannot operate continuously for long periods of time. In this work, we propose a zero-shot imitation learning framework for training a goal-driven visual navigation policy on a legged robot from human demonstrations (third-person perspective), allowing for high-quality navigation and cost-effective data collection. However, imitation learning from third-person demonstrations raises unique challenges. First, these demonstrations are captured from different camera perspectives, which we address via a feature disentanglement network (FDN) that extracts perspective-invariant state features. Second, as transition dynamics vary between systems, we reconstruct missing action labels by either building an inverse model of the robot's dynamics in the feature space and applying it to the human demonstrations or developing a Graphic User Interface (GUI) to label human demonstrations. To train a navigation policy we use a model-based imitation learning approach with FDN and action-labeled human demonstrations. We show that our framework can learn an effective policy for a legged robot, Laikago, from human demonstrations in both simulated and real-world environments. Our approach is zero-shot as the robot never navigates the same paths during training as those at testing time. We justify our framework by performing a comparative study.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9196602/
Impact Mitigation for Dynamic Legged Robots with Steel Wire Transmission Using Nonlinear Active  Compliance Control,"Impact mitigation is crucial to the stable locomotion of legged robots, especially in high-speed dynamic locomotion. This paper presents a leg locomotion system, including the nonlinear active compliance control and the active impedance control for the steel wire transmission-based legged robot. The developed control system enables high-speed dynamic locomotion with excellent impact mitigation and leg position tracking performance, where three strategies are applied. a) The feed-forward controller is designed according to the linear motor-leg model with the information of Coulomb friction and viscous friction. b) Steel wire transmission model-based compensation guarantees ideal virtual spring compliance characteristics. c) Nonlinear active compliance control and active impedance control ensure better impact mitigation performance than linear scheme and guarantee position tracking performance. The proposed control system is verified on a real robot named SCIT Dog, and the experiment demonstrates the ideal impact mitigation ability in high-speed dynamic locomotion without any passive spring mechanism.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561641/
Configuration Transformation of the Wheel-Legged Robot Using Inverse Dynamics Control,"In this paper, the configuration transformation of Wheel-Legged Robot (WLR) is studied, which can enable the robot to change its multilinks configuration on Inverted Equilibrium Manifold (IEM), while keeping balance with a small location drift on the floor. First of all, the general form of dynamics equation of planar Articulated Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (AWIP) with a wheel and n − 1 rigid links, is derived. The Partial Feedback Linearization (PFL) combined with a Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is used to design the inverse dynamics controller of AWIP, while considering full dynamics terms. The well-known WLR model is used as a simple example of AWIP to accomplish the configuration transformation task. An optimization based configuration transformation algorithm is proposed to realize a comprehensive optimization of the shortest path in joint space and the minimum location drift of WLR on the floor. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation to implement the configuration transformation task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560781/
 Online Lidar-SLAM for Legged Robots with Robust Registration and Deep-Learned Loop Closure,"In this paper, we present a 3D factor-graph LiDAR-SLAM system which incorporates a state-of-the-art deeply learned feature-based loop closure detector to enable a legged robot to localize and map in industrial environments. Point clouds are accumulated using an inertial-kinematic state estimator before being aligned using ICP registration. To close loops we use a loop proposal mechanism which matches individual segments between clouds. We trained a descriptor offline to match these segments. The efficiency of our method comes from carefully designing the network architecture to minimize the number of parameters such that this deep learning method can be deployed in real-time using only the CPU of a legged robot, a major contribution of this work. The set of odometry and loop closure factors are updated using pose graph optimization. Finally we present an efficient risk alignment prediction method which verifies the reliability of the registrations. Experimental results at an industrial facility demonstrated the robustness and flexibility of our system, including autonomous following paths derived from the SLAM map.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9196769/
Preintegrated Velocity Bias Estimation to Overcome Contact Nonlinearities in Legged Robot Odometry,"In this paper, we present a novel factor graph formulation to estimate the pose and velocity of a quadruped robot on slippery and deformable terrain. The factor graph introduces a preintegrated velocity factor that incorporates velocity inputs from leg odometry and also estimates related biases. From our experimentation we have seen that it is difficult to model uncertainties at the contact point such as slip or deforming terrain, as well as leg flexibility. To accommodate for these effects and to minimize leg odometry drift, we extend the robot's state vector with a bias term for this preintegrated velocity factor. The bias term can be accurately estimated thanks to the tight fusion of the preintegrated velocity factor with stereo vision and IMU factors, without which it would be unobservable. The system has been validated on several scenarios that involve dynamic motions of the ANYmal robot on loose rocks, slopes and muddy ground. We demonstrate a 26% improvement of relative pose error compared to our previous work and 52% compared to a state-of-the-art proprioceptive state estimator.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9197214/
High-Flexibility Locomotion and Whole-Torso Control for a Wheel-Legged Robot on Challenging Terrain,"In this paper, we propose a parallel six-wheel-legged robot that can traverse irregular terrain while carrying objectives to do heavy-duty work. This robot is equipped with six Stewart platforms as legs and tightly integrates the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the wheels. The presented control strategy with physical system used to adapt the diverse degrees of each leg to irregular terrain such that robot increases the traversability, and simultaneously to maintain the horizontal whole-torso pose. This strategy makes use of Contact Scheduler (CS) and Whole-Torso Control (WTC) to control the multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) leg for performing high-flexibility locomotion and adapting the rough terrain like actively parallel suspension system. We conducted experiments on flat, slope, soft and sand-gravel surface, which validate the proposed control method and physical system. Especially, we attempt to traverse over sand-gravel terrain with 3 people about 240kg payload.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9197526/
The Dynamic Effect of Mechanical Losses of Transmissions on the Equations of Motion of Legged  Robots,"Industrial manipulators do not collapse under their own weight when powered off due to the friction in their joints. Although these mechanism are effective for stiff position control of pick-and-place, they are inappropriate for legged robots that must rapidly regulate compliant interactions with the environment. However, no metric exists to quantify the robot’s performance degradation due to mechanical losses in the actuators and transmissions. This paper provides a fundamental formulation that uses the mechanical efficiency of transmissions to quantify the effect of power losses in the mechanical transmissions on the dynamics of a whole robotic system. We quantitatively demonstrate the intuitive fact that the apparent inertia of the robots increase in the presence of joint friction. We also show that robots that employ high gear ratio and low efficiency transmissions can statically sustain more substantial external loads. We expect that the framework presented here will provide the fundamental tools for designing the next generation of legged robots that can effectively interact with the world.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561739/
Dynamics Consensus between Centroidal and Whole-Body Models in Locomotion of Legged Robots,"It is nowadays well-established that locomotion can be written as a large and complex optimal control problem. Yet, current knowledge in numerical solver fails to directly solve it. A common approach is to cut the dimensionality by relying on reduced models (inverted pendulum, capture points, centroidal). However it is difficult both to account for whole-body constraints at the reduced level and also to define what is an acceptable trade-off at the whole-body level between tracking the reduced solution or searching for a new one. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a rigorous mathematical framework based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to enforce the consensus between the centroidal state dynamics at reduced and whole-body level. We propose an exact splitting of the whole-body optimal control problem between the centroidal dynamics (under-actuation) and the manipulator dynamics (full actuation), corresponding to a re-arrangement of the equations already stated in previous works. We then describe with details how alternating descent is a good solution to implement an effective locomotion solver. We validate this approach in simulation with walking experiments on the HRP-2 robot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8793878/
Rapidly Adaptable Legged Robots Via Evolutionary Meta-Learning,"Learning adaptable policies is crucial for robots to operate autonomously in our complex and quickly changing world. In this work, we present a new meta-learning method that allows robots to quickly adapt to changes in dynamics. In contrast to gradient-based meta-learning algorithms that rely on second-order gradient estimation, we introduce a more noise-tolerant Batch Hill-Climbing adaptation operator and combine it with meta-learning based on evolutionary strategies. Our method significantly improves adaptation to changes in dynamics in high noise settings, which are common in robotics applications. We validate our approach on a quadruped robot that learns to walk while subject to changes in dynamics. We observe that our method significantly outperforms prior gradient-based approaches, enabling the robot to adapt its policy to changes based on less than 3 minutes of real data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341571/
Walking Posture Adaptation for Legged Robot Navigation in Confined Spaces,"Legged robots have the ability to adapt their walking posture to navigate confined spaces due to their high degrees of freedom. However, this has not been exploited in most common multilegged platforms. This letter presents a deformable bounding box abstraction of the robot model, with accompanying mapping and planning strategies, that enable a legged robot to autonomously change its body shape to navigate confined spaces. The mapping is achieved using robot-centric multi-elevation maps generated with distance sensors carried by the robot. The path planning is based on the trajectory optimization algorithm CHOMP that creates smooth trajectories while avoiding obstacles. The proposed method has been tested in simulation and implemented on the hexapod robot Weaver, which is 33 cm tall and 82 cm wide when walking normally. We demonstrate navigating under 25 cm overhanging obstacles, through 70 cm wide gaps and over 22 cm high obstacles in both artificial testing spaces and realistic environments, including a subterranean mining tunnel.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8642939/
Robust Legged Robot State Estimation Using Factor Graph Optimization,"Legged robots, specifically quadrupeds, are becoming increasingly attractive for industrial applications such as inspection. However, to leave the laboratory and to become useful to an end user requires reliability in harsh conditions. From the perspective of state estimation, it is essential to be able to accurately estimate the robot's state despite challenges such as uneven or slippery terrain, textureless and reflective scenes, as well as dynamic camera occlusions. We are motivated to reduce the dependency on foot contact classifications, which fail when slipping, and to reduce position drift during dynamic motions such as trotting. To this end, we present a factor graph optimization method for state estimation which tightly fuses and smooths inertial navigation, leg odometry and visual odometry. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using the ANYmal quadruped robot navigating in a realistic outdoor industrial environment. This experiment included trotting, walking, crossing obstacles and ascending a staircase. The proposed approach decreased the relative position error by up to 55% and absolute position error by 76% compared to kinematic-inertial odometry.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8790726/
A Passive Hydraulic Auxiliary System Designed for Increasing Legged Robot Payload and  Efficiency,"Load-carrying capability is an essential criterion in legged robots' practical application. This paper proposes an unpowered hydraulic auxiliary system to improve the legged robot's loading capability and energy efficiency. For humans, it has been widely hypothesized that intra-abdominal pressure can reduce potential injurious compressive force imposed on spinal discs when a person lifts heavy objects. Inspired by this human biomechanical phenomenon, we design a novel loading-carrying strategy using hydraulic cylinders, valves and accumulators. Different from ordinary powered hydraulic systems, this design provides continuous support force to share the load applied on knee joint actuator without consuming extra energy. The bent-leg theoretical model is constructed to validate the design and analysis. A bipedal hydraulic-assisted electric leg prototype (HyELeg) is fabricated and tested for squatting and walking gaits. The results show that with hydraulic assistance, the prototype can save energy by 45.9% for squatting with a load of 125% of its own body weight, and the walking performance is enhanced by 16.9% in energy efficiency with carrying a load of 67.5% of its own body weight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561581/
GaitMesh: Controller-Aware Navigation Meshes for Long-Range Legged Locomotion Planning in Multi-Layered Environments,"Long-range locomotion planning is an important problem for the deployment of legged robots to real scenarios. Current methods used for legged locomotion planning often do not exploit the flexibility of legged robots, and do not scale well with environment size. In this letter we propose the use of navigation meshes for deployment in large-scale multi-floor sites. We leverage this representation to improve long-term locomotion plans in terms of success rates, path costs and reasoning about which gait-controller to use when. We show that NavMeshes have higher planning success rates than sampling-based planners, but are 400x faster to construct and at least 100x faster to plan with. The performance gap further increases when considering multi-floor environments. We present both a procedure for building controller-aware NavMeshes and a full navigation system that adapts to changes to the environment. We demonstrate the capabilities of the system in simulation experiments and in field trials at a real-world oil rig facility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9028233/
Body Lift and Drag for a Legged Millirobot in Compliant Beam Environment,"Much current study of legged locomotion has rightly focused on foot traction forces, including on granular media. Future legged millirobots will need to go through terrain, such as brush or other vegetation, where the body contact forces significantly affect locomotion. In this work, a (previously developed) low-cost 6-axis force/torque sensing shell is used to measure the interaction forces between a hexapedal millirobot and a set of compliant beams, which act as a surrogate for a densely cluttered environment. Experiments with a VelociRoACH robotic platform are used to measure lift and drag forces on the tactile shell, where negative lift forces can increase traction, even while drag forces increase. The drag energy and specific resistance required to pass through dense terrains can be measured. Furthermore, some contact between the robot and the compliant beams can lower specific resistance of locomotion. For small, light-weight legged robots in the beam environment, the body motion depends on both legground and body-beam forces. A shell-shape which reduces drag but increases negative lift, such as the half-ellipsoid used, is suggested to be advantageous for robot locomotion in this type of environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8793597/
Sparse Optimization of Contact Forces for Balancing Control of Multi-Legged Humanoids,"Multi-legged humanoid platforms present an inherent redundancy in the number of end-effectors required to perform interaction tasks, such as balancing and manipulation. The most relevant possibility opened up by end-effector redundancy consists in using a subset of the available end-effectors to perform a primary task, while employing the remaining end-effectors to perform a secondary tasks. As a consequence, it necessarily requires a methodology to automatically find the smallest set of end-effectors required to perform a primary task. For the balancing control of a torque-controlled humanoid, this is equivalent to finding a sparse solution of a contact force distribution problem. To this end, two different sparse optimization approaches are presented and extensively discussed in this work. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches has been validated on a simulated model of the CENTAURO robot developed at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8620532/
Probe-Before-Step Walking Strategy for Multi-Legged Robots on Terrain with Risk of Collapse,"Multi-legged robots are effective at traversing rough terrain. However, terrains that include collapsible footholds (i.e. regions that can collapse when stepped on) remain a significant challenge, especially since such situations can be extremely difficult to anticipate using only exteroceptive sensing. State-of-the-art methods typically use various stabilisation techniques to regain balance and counter changing footholds. However, these methods are likely to fail if safe footholds are sparse and spread out or if the robot does not respond quickly enough after a foothold collapse. This paper presents a novel method for multi-legged robots to probe and test the terrain for collapses using its legs while walking. The proposed method improves on existing terrain probing approaches, and integrates the probing action into a walking cycle. A follow-the-leader strategy with a suitable gait and stance is presented and implemented on a hexapod robot. The proposed method is experimentally validated, demonstrating the robot can safely traverse terrain containing collapsible footholds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9197154/
Extracting Legged Locomotion Heuristics with Regularized Predictive Control,"Optimization based predictive control is a powerful tool that has improved the ability of legged robots to execute dynamic maneuvers and traverse increasingly difficult terrains. However, it is often challenging and unintuitive to design meaningful cost functions and build high-fidelity models while adhering to timing restrictions. A novel framework to extract and design principled regularization heuristics for legged locomotion optimization control is presented. By allowing a simulation to fully explore the cost space offline, certain states and actions can be constrained or isolated. Data is fit with simple models relating the desired commands, optimal control actions, and robot states to identify new heuristic candidates. Basic parameter learning and adaptation laws are then applied to the models online. This method extracts simple, but powerful heuristics that can approximate complex dynamics and account for errors stemming from model simplifications and parameter uncertainty without the loss of physical intuition while generalizing the parameter tuning process. Results on the Mini Cheetah robot verify the increased capabilities due to the newly extracted heuristics without any modification to the controller structure or gains.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9197488/
Haptic Inspection of Planetary Soils with Legged Robots,"Planetary exploration robots encounter challenging terrain during operation. Vision-based approaches have failed to reliably predict soil characteristics in the past, making it necessary to probe the terrain tactilely. We present a robust, haptic inspection approach for a variety of fine, granular media, which are representative of Martian soil. In our approach, the robot uses one limb to perform an impact trajectory, while supporting the main body with the remaining three legs. The resulting vibration, which is recorded by sensors placed in the foot, is decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and assigned a soil class by a support vector machine. We tested two foot designs and validated the robustness of this approach through the extensive use of an open-source dataset, which we recorded on a specially designed single-foot testbed. A remarkable overall classification accuracy of more than 98% could be achieved despite various introduced disturbances. The contributions of different sensors to the classification performance are evaluated. Finally, we test the generalization performance on unknown soils and show that the interaction behavior can be anticipated.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8630524/
Combined Sampling and Optimization Based Planning for Legged-Wheeled Robots,"Planning for legged-wheeled machines is typically done using trajectory optimization because of many degrees of freedom, thus rendering legged-wheeled planners prone to falling prey to bad local minima. We present a combined sampling and optimization-based planning approach that can cope with challenging terrain. The sampling-based stage computes whole-body configurations and contact schedule, which speeds up the optimization convergence. The optimization-based stage ensures that all the system constraints, such as non-holonomic rolling constraints, are satisfied. The evaluations show the importance of good initial guesses for optimization. Furthermore, they suggest that terrain/collision (avoidance) constraints are more challenging than the robot model’s constraints. Lastly, we extend the optimization to handle general terrain representations in the form of elevation maps.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560731/
Online Optimal Impedance Planning for Legged Robots,"Real world applications require robots to operate in unstructured environments. This kind of scenarios may lead to unexpected environmental contacts or undesired interactions, which may harm people or impair the robot. Adjusting the behavior of the system through impedance control techniques is an effective solution to these problems. However, selecting an adequate impedance is not a straightforward process. Normally, robot users manually tune the controller gains with trial and error methods. This approach is generally slow and requires practice. Moreover, complex tasks may require different impedance during different phases of the task. This paper introduces an optimization algorithm for online planning of the Cartesian robot impedance to adapt to changes in the task, robot configuration, expected disturbances, external environment and desired performance, without employing any direct force measurements. We provide an analytical solution leveraging the mass-spring-damper behavior that is conferred to the robot body by the Cartesian impedance controller. Stability during gains variation is also guaranteed. The effectiveness of the method is experimentally validated on the quadrupedal robot ANYmal. The variable impedance helps the robot to tackle challenging scenarios like walking on rough terrain and colliding with an obstacle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8967696/
Restoring Force Design of Active Self-Healing Tension Transmission System and Application to  Tendon-Driven Legged Robot,"Self-healing function is a promising approach for damage management of high-load robot applications such as legged robots. Although the function is getting major in soft robotics, its application to life-sized ""stiff"" robots is of relatively minor interest. Although the authors have devised several self-healing tensile modules for tendon-driven robots, the design guideline to satisfy the large load endurance and large stroke is still unclear. The paper focuses on the parametric design for unleaked liquid-assisted healing of low melting point alloy structure. The method was validated with a benchtop module test. Moreover, the module enabled tendon-driven monopod testbed to perform squat motion three times after the landing impact fracture and the self-healing sequence, which was never accomplished.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561531/
An Approach of Facilitated Investigation of Active Self-healing Tension Transmission System Oriented for Legged Robots,"Self-healing robotics has been of considerable interest. We believe the function will have a major role in legged robots as a typical high-load application of robotics. Some pioneering works have been ongoing on self-healing soft robots. However, the development of large load self-healing component and its system integration with a life-sized legged robot is a challenging task. This study is to try the problem by a constructing self-healing component oriented for facilitated investigation. Proposed part enhances visibility and manufacturing by specializing tension transmission system. The developed module was evaluated by several experiments. First, healing visualization experiment was conducted to evaluate healing progress. In addition, the module's strength was tested using a motor-driven tendon module previously developed in our laboratory. Results of these experiments suggested that the stirring process have a major role in performing self-healing behaviour. Finally, we conducted a preliminary experiment on a tendon-driven legged robot. The experiment demonstrated that the module functioned in a real robot once.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8967949/
on the Hardware Feasibility of Nonlinear Trajectory Optimization for Legged Locomotion Based on a Simplified Dynamics,"Simplified models are useful to increase the computational efficiency of a motion planning algorithm, but their lack of accuracy have to be managed. We propose two feasibility constraints to be included in a Single Rigid Body Dynamics-based trajectory optimizer in order to obtain robust motions in challenging terrain. The first one finds an approximate relationship between joint-torque limits and admissible contact forces, without requiring the joint positions. The second one proposes a leg model to prevent leg collision with the environment. Such constraints have been included in a simplified nonlinear non-convex trajectory optimization problem. We demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting motion plans both in simulation and on the Hydraulically actuated Quadruped (HyQ) robot, considering experiments on an irregular terrain.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9196903/
Stair Climbing Capability-Based Dimensional Synthesis for the Multi-Legged Robot,"Staircase is a typical obstacle for the legged robot to overcome in buildings. This paper studies the stair climbing capability-based dimensional synthesis for a hexapod legged robot, i.e., exploring how to determine the leg length and the longitudinal body length concerning the target staircase in the mechanical design stage. In climbing a staircase, leg-staircase interference is one of the predominant issues. The three possible interference cases are illustrated in detail with a 2-DOF (degree of freedom) leg mechanism and the staircase size, based on the predefined tripod gait sequence. The mathematical relationships between the leg length, longitudinal body length, and the target staircase size are derived. The leg length and the body length are finally determined with the target staircase size. The virtual simulations and prototype experiments verify the effectiveness of the dimensional synthesis for the hexapod robot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9562004/
Line Walking and Balancing for Legged Robots with Point Feet,"The ability of legged systems to traverse highly- constrained environments depends by and large on the performance of their motion and balance controllers. This paper presents a controller that excels in a scenario that most state- of-the-art balance controllers have not yet addressed: line walking, or walking on nearly null support regions. Our approach uses a low-dimensional virtual model (2-DoF) to generate balancing actions through a previously derived four- term balance controller and transforms them to the robot through a derived kinematic mapping. The capabilities of this controller are tested in simulation, where we show the 90kg quadruped robot HyQ crossing a bridge of only 6 cm width (compared to its 4 cm diameter spherical foot), by balancing on two feet at any time while moving along a line. Additional simulations are carried to test the performance of the controller and the effect of external disturbances. Lastly, we present our preliminary experimental results showing HyQ balancing on two legs while being disturbed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341743/
Feedback MPC for Torque-Controlled Legged Robots,"The computational power of mobile robots is currently insufficient to achieve torque level whole-body Model Predictive Control (MPC) at the update rates required for complex dynamic systems such as legged robots. This problem is commonly circumvented by using a fast tracking controller to compensate for model errors between updates. In this work, we show that the feedback policy from a Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) based MPC algorithm is a viable alternative to bridge the gap between the low MPC update rate and the actuation command rate. We propose to augment the DDP approach with a relaxed barrier function to address inequality constraints arising from the friction cone. A frequency-dependent cost function is used to reduce the sensitivity to high-frequency model errors and actuator bandwidth limits. We demonstrate that our approach can find stable locomotion policies for the torque-controlled quadruped, ANYmal, both in simulation and on hardware.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8968251/
Dynamic Legged Manipulation of a Ball through Multi-Contact Optimization,"The feet of robots are typically used to design locomotion strategies, such as balancing, walking, and running. However, they also have great potential to perform manipulation tasks. In this paper, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) framework for a quadrupedal robot to dynamically balance on a ball and simultaneously manipulate it to follow various trajectories such as straight lines, sinusoids, circles and in-place turning. We numerically validate our controller on the Mini Cheetah robot using different gaits including trotting, bounding, and pronking on the ball.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341218/
Reactive Support Polygon Adaptation for the Hybrid Legged-Wheeled CENTAURO Robot,"The need for robots operating in the real-world has sparked interest in hybrid locomotion that combines the versatile legged mobility with a simpler wheeled motion. The use of legged-wheeled robots in complex real-world scenarios requires controllers that will capitalise on this flexibility. In this work, a reactive control scheme that exploits wheels steering and robot articulated legs is proposed to continuously adjust the robot support polygon (SP) in response to unknown disturbances. The designed cartesian-space control is expressed in the joint-space to account for the hardware limits. To tackle the non-holonomy in the joint-space model, the linear velocity/acceleration-based model is developed for the general legged-wheeled platform and applied to resolve the SP adaptation of a platform with steerable wheels. The proposed control is experimentally verified on the CENTAURO robot, demonstrating the SP adjustment when external disturbances are applied.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972392/
A Coordinate-Based Approach for Static Balancing and Walking Control of Compliantly Actuated Legged Robots,"The paper addresses the static balancing and walking of elastically actuated legged robots. The control is realized by commanding the motor positions only and exploiting the bijective relation between motor and link positions at equilibrium under static external forces. The approach is formulated in a quite general framework first. The main implementation contribution is the definition of a body coordinate system and of an appropriate set of constraints, which leads to a fully determined system of equations. In addition to the desired COM and the vertical foot positions, which are defined by the walking task and the terrain, the imposed constraints are related to distances between individual legs. The controller is experimentally validated on a compliantly actuated quadruped.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8793920/
Multi-Layered Safety for Legged Robots Via Control Barrier Functions and Model Predictive Control,"The problem of dynamic locomotion over rough terrain requires both accurate foot placement together with an emphasis on dynamic stability. Existing approaches to this problem prioritize immediate safe foot placement over longer term dynamic stability considerations, or relegate the coordination of foot placement and dynamic stability to heuristic methods. We propose a multi-layered locomotion framework that unifies Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to simultaneously achieve safe foot placement and dynamic stability. Our approach incorporates CBF based safety constraints both in a low frequency kinodynamic MPC formulation and a high frequency inverse dynamics tracking controller. This ensures that safety-critical execution is considered when optimizing locomotion over a longer horizon. We validate the proposed method in a 3D stepping-stone scenario in simulation and experimentally on the ANYmal quadruped platform.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561510/
Hybrid Systems Differential Dynamic Programming for Whole-Body Motion Planning of Legged Robots,"This letter presents a Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework for trajectory optimization (TO) of hybrid systems with state-based switching. The proposed Hybrid Systems DDP (HS-DDP) approach is considered for application to whole-body motion planning with legged robots. Specifically, HS-DDP incorporates three algorithmic advances: an impact-aware DDP step addressing the impact event in legged locomotion, an Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method dealing with the switching constraint, and a Switching Time Optimization (STO) algorithm that optimizes switching times by leveraging the structure of DDP. Further, a Relaxed Barrier (ReB) method is used to manage inequality constraints and is integrated into HS-DDP for locomotion planning. The performance of the developed algorithms is benchmarked on a simulation model of the MIT Mini Cheetah executing a bounding gait. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AL and ReB for handling switching constraints, friction constraints, and torque limits. By comparing to previous solutions, we show that the STO algorithm achieves 2.3 times more reduction of total switching times, demonstrating the efficiency of our method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9134911/
Towards More Possibilities: Motion Planning and Control for Hybrid Locomotion of Wheeled-Legged Robots,"This letter proposed a control framework to tackle the hybrid locomotion problem of wheeled-legged robots. It comes as a hierarchical structure with three layers: hybrid foot placement planning, Centre of Mass (CoM) trajectory optimization and whole-body control. General mathematical representation of foot movement is developed to analyze different motion modes and decide hybrid foot placements. Gait graph widely used in legged locomotion is extended to better describe the hybrid movement by adding extra foot velocity information. Thereafter, model predictive control is introduced to optimize the CoM trajectory based on the planned foot placements considering terrain height changing. The desired trajectories together with other kinematic and dynamic constraints are fed into a whole-body controller to produce joint commands. In the end, the feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by the simulation and experiments of hybrid locomotion running on our wheeled quadrupedal robot Pholus.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9028198/
State Estimation for Hybrid Wheeled-Legged Robots Performing Mobile Manipulation Tasks,"This paper introduces a general state estimation framework fusing multiple sensor information for hybrid wheeled-legged robots performing mobile manipulation tasks. At the core of the state estimator is a novel unified odometry for hybrid locomotion which can seamlessly maintain tracking and has no need to switch between stepping and rolling modes. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed odometry is the first work in this area. It is calculated based on the robot kinematics and instantaneous contact points of wheels with sensor inputs from IMU, joint encoders, joint torque sensors estimating wheel contact status, as well as RGB-D camera detecting geometric features of the terrain (e.g. elevation and surface normal vector). Subsequently, the odometry output is utilized as the motion model of a 3D Lidar map-based Monte Carlo Localization module for drift-free state estimation. As part of the framework, visual localization is integrated to provide high precision guidance for the robot movement relative to an object of interest. The proposed approach was verified thoroughly by two experiments conducted on the Pholus robot with OptiTrack measurements as ground truth.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560948/
Balance Control of a Novel Wheel-Legged Robot: Design and Experiments,"This paper presents a balance control technique for a novel wheel-legged robot. We first derive a dynamic model of the robot and then apply a linear feedback controller based on output regulation and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) methods to maintain the standing of the robot on the ground without moving backward and forward mightily. To take into account nonlinearities of the model and obtain a large domain of stability, a nonlinear controller based on the interconnection and damping assignment - passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) method is exploited to control the robot in more general scenarios. Physical experiments are performed with various control tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed linear output regulator can maintain the standing of the robot, while the proposed nonlinear controller can balance the robot under an initial starting angle far away from the equilibrium point, or under a changing robot height.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561579/
Computational Design of Energy-Efficient Legged Robots: Optimizing for Size and Actuators,"This paper presents a computational framework for the design of high-performance legged robotic systems. The framework relies on the concurrent optimization of hardware parameters and control trajectories to find the best robot design for a given task. In particular, we focus on energy efficiency, presenting novel electro-mechanical models to account for the losses of the actuators due to friction and Joule effects. Thanks to a bi-level optimization scheme, featuring a genetic algorithm in the outer loop, our framework can also optimize for the duration of the motion, the actuators, and the size of the robot. We present a novel approach to scale both the actuators and the robot structure in a way that ensures structural integrity by maintaining constant the normalized deflection of the links. We validated our approach by designing a two-joint monoped robot to execute a jumping task. Our simulation results show that our framework can lead to remarkable energy savings (up to 60%) thanks to the concurrent optimization of robot size, motion duration, and actuators.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560988/

A Legged Soft Robot Platform for Dynamic Locomotion,"This paper presents an open-source untethered quadrupedal soft robot platform for dynamic locomotion (e.g., high-speed running and backflipping). The robot is mostly soft (80 vol.%) while driven by four geared servo motors. The robot’s soft body and soft legs were 3D printed with gyroid infill using a flexible material, enabling it to conform to the environment and passively stabilize during locomotion in multi-terrain environments. In addition, we simulated the robot in a real-time soft body simulation. With tuned gaits in simulation, the real robot can locomote at a speed of 0.9 m/s (2.5 body length/second), substantially faster than most untethered legged soft robots published to date. We hope this platform, along with its verified simulator, can catalyze agile soft robots' development.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561018/
A Model-Free Solution for Stable Balancing and Locomotion of Floating-Base Legged Systems,"This paper presents novel control techniques for passivation and stabilisation of floating-base systems with contacts, whose dynamical models comprise both joint-space, and Cartesian floating-base coordinates. The aforementioned results are achieved using both minimally model-based, and completely model-free controllers that employ power-shaping signals. Model-free control is permitted through usage of a decoupled dynamical model, procured via coordinate transformation operations. It is demonstrated that even though passive closed-loop systems are attainable without utilisation of exteroceptive feedback, global stabilisation of a floating-base robot necessitates direct usage of either measured or estimated external forces. The presented asymptotical stabilisation results pertain to both the set-point regulation, and trajectory-tracking cases, thereby ensuring suitability for static balancing, and dynamical locomotion tasks. To ensure practicability and production of feasible input signals, a variable impedance control, power-shaping term is appended to the original design, wherein it circumstantially serves as either a power-dissipating, or power-injecting element. This enhancement provably preserves closed-loop stability, by appositely shaping the system's power. Experiments involving a metamorphic, quadrupedal walking robot, corroborate the theoretical analysis, as they attest to the system's ability to stably execute locomotory tasks using a single, unified, model-free control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341255/
Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Multi-Legged Robot Jumping Via Mixed-Integer Convex Program,"This paper proposes a kinodynamic motion plan-ning framework for multi-legged robot jumping based on the mixed-integer convex program (MICP), which simultaneously reasons about centroidal motion, contact points, wrench, and gait sequences. This method uniquely combines configuration space discretization and the construction of feasible wrench polytope (FWP) to encode kinematic constraints, actuator limit, friction cone constraint, and gait sequencing into a single MICP. The MICP could be efficiently solved to the global optimum by off-the-shelf numerical solvers and provide highly dynamic jumping motions without requiring initial guesses. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could find novel and dexterous maneuvers that are directly deployable on the two-legged robot platform to traverse through challenging terrains.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341572/

Fast Global Motion Planning for Dynamic Legged Robots,"This work presents a motion planning algorithm for legged robots capable of constructing long-horizon dynamic plans in real-time. Many existing methods use models that prohibit flight phases or even require static stability, while those that permit these dynamics often plan over short horizons or take minutes to compute. The algorithm presented here resolves these issues through a reduced-order dynamical model that handles motion primitives with stance and flight phases and supports an RRT-Connect framework for rapid exploration. Kinematic and dynamic constraint approximations are computed efficiently and validated with a whole-body trajectory optimization. The algorithm is tested over challenging terrain requiring long planning horizons and dynamic motions in seconds - an order of magnitude faster than existing methods. The speed and global nature of the planner offer a new level of autonomy for legged robot applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341438/
Collision-Free MPC for Legged Robots in Static and Dynamic Scenes,"We present a model predictive controller (MPC) that automatically discovers collision-free locomotion while simultaneously taking into account the system dynamics, friction constraints, and kinematic limitations. A relaxed barrier function is added to the optimization’s cost function, leading to collision avoidance behavior without increasing the problem’s computational complexity. Our holistic approach does not require any heuristics and enables legged robots to find whole-body motions in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. We use a dynamically generated euclidean signed distance field for static collision checking. Collision checking for dynamic obstacles is modeled with moving cylinders, increasing the responsiveness to fast-moving agents. Furthermore, we include a Kalman filter motion prediction for moving obstacles into our receding horizon planning, enabling the robot to anticipate possible future collisions. Our experiments

An Open Torque-Controlled Modular Robot Architecture for Legged Locomotion Research,"We present a new open-source torque-controlled legged robot system, with a low-cost and low-complexity actuator module at its core. It consists of a high-torque brushless DC motor and a low-gear-ratio transmission suitable for impedance and force control. We also present a novel foot contact sensor suitable for legged locomotion with hard impacts. A 2.2 kg quadruped robot with a large range of motion is assembled from eight identical actuator modules and four lower legs with foot contact sensors. Leveraging standard plastic 3D printing and off-the-shelf parts results in a lightweight and inexpensive robot, allowing for rapid distribution and duplication within the research community. We systematically characterize the achieved impedance at the foot in both static and dynamic scenarios, and measure a maximum dimensionless leg stiffness of 10.8 without active damping, which is comparable to the leg stiffness of a running human. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the quadruped, we present a novel controller which combines feedforward contact forces computed from a kino-dynamic optimizer with impedance control of the center of mass and base orientation. The controller can regulate complex motions while being robust to environmental uncertainty.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9015985/
Feedback Motion Planning of Legged Robots by Composing Orbital Lyapunov Functions Using Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees,"We present a sampling-based framework for feedback motion planning of legged robots. Our framework is based on switching between limit cycles at a fixed instance of motion, the Poincaré section (e.g., apex or touchdown), by finding overlaps between the regions of attraction (ROA) of two limit cycles. First, we assume a candidate orbital Lyapunov function (OLF) and define a ROA at the Poincaré section. Next, we solve multiple trajectory optimization problems, one for each sampled initial condition on the ROA to minimize an energy metric and subject to the exponential convergence of the OLF between two steps. The result is a table of control actions and the corresponding initial conditions at the Poincaré section. Then we develop a control policy for each control action as a function of the initial condition using deep learning neural networks. The control policy is validated by testing on initial conditions sampled on ROA of randomly chosen limit cycles. Finally, the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm is adopted to plan transitions between the limit cycles using the ROAs. The approach is demonstrated on a hopper model to achieve velocity and height transitions between steps.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8793578/
Trajectory Optimization for Wheeled-Legged Quadrupedal Robots Using Linearized ZMP Constraints,"We present a trajectory optimizer for quadrupedal robots with actuated wheels. By solving for angular, vertical, and planar components of the base and feet trajectories in a cascaded fashion and by introducing a novel linear formulation of the zeromoment point balance criterion, we rely on quadratic programming only, thereby eliminating the need for nonlinear optimization routines. Yet, even for gaits containing full flight phases, we are able to generate trajectories for executing complex motions that involve simultaneous driving, walking, and turning. We verified our approach in simulations of the quadrupedal robot ANYmal equipped with wheels, where we are able to run the proposed trajectory optimizer at 50 Hz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such dynamic motions are demonstrated for wheeled-legged quadrupedal robots using an online motion planner.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8630448/
Online Relative Footstep Optimization for Legged Robots Dynamic Walking Using Discrete-Time Model Predictive Control,"We present a unified control framework that generates dynamic walking motions for biped and quadruped robots with online relative footstep optimization. The footstep optimization is formulated as a discrete-time Model Predictive Control problem which determines future footstep locations. The framework has a hierarchical structure consisting of three layers: footstep planner, trajectory generator and whole-body controller. The footstep planner plans next footstep position based on Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model. Relative footstep optimization is proposed to enable automatic footstep planning without the use of any predefined footstep sequences. The trajectory generator will generate CoM and feet trajectory given the next footstep placement. In order to generalize to quadruped robots, “virtual leg” concept has been used to coordinate leg pair movement. The whole-body inverse dynamic controller calculates joint torques to track given Cartesian reference trajectories. To include under-actuation into consideration, contact vertices formulation of ground reaction forces (GRFs) has been adopted. Generalized whole-body controller can handle biped robot with line feet as well as quadruped robots with point feet walking with dynamic gaits. Several simulations have been performed to demonstrate the robustness and generality of the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8968028/
Sensitivity of Legged Balance Control to Uncertainties and Sampling Period,"We propose to quantify the effect of sensor and actuator uncertainties on the control of the center of mass and center of pressure in legged robots, since this is central for maintaining their balance with a limited support polygon. Our approach is based on robust control theory, considering uncertainties that can take any value between specified bounds. This provides a principled approach to deciding optimal feedback gains. Surprisingly, our main observation is that the sampling period can be as long as 200 ms with literally no impact on maximum tracking error and, as a result, on the guarantee that balance can be maintained safely. Our findings are validated in simulations and experiments with the torque-controlled humanoid robot Toro developed at DLR. The proposed mathematical derivations and results apply nevertheless equally to biped and quadruped robots.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8758907/
ULT-Model: Towards a One-Legged Unified Locomotion Template Model for Forward Hopping with  an Upright Trunk,"While many advancements have been made in the development of template models for describing upright-trunk locomotion, the majority of the effort has been focused on the stance phase. In this paper, we develop a new compact dynamic model as a first step toward a fully unified locomotion template model (ULT-model) of an upright-trunk forward hopping system, which will also require a unified control law in the next step. We demonstrate that all locomotion subfunctions are enabled by adding just a point foot mass and a parallel leg actuator to the well-known trunk SLIP model and that a stable limit cycle can be achieved. This brings us closer toward the ultimate goal of enabling closed-loop dynamics for anchor matching and thus achieving simple, efficient, robust and stable upright-trunk gait control, as observed in biological systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560780/
Learning a Centroidal Motion Planner for Legged Locomotion,"Whole-body optimizers have been successful at automatically computing complex dynamic locomotion behaviors. However they are often limited to offline planning as they are computationally too expensive to replan with a high frequency. Simpler models are then typically used for online replanning. In this paper we present a method to generate whole body movements in real-time for locomotion tasks. Our approach consists in learning a centroidal neural network that predicts the desired centroidal motion given the current state of the robot and a desired contact plan. The network is trained using an existing whole body motion optimizer. Our approach enables to learn with few training samples dynamic motions that can be used in a complete whole-body control framework at high frequency, which is usually not attainable with typical full-body optimizers. We demonstrate our method to generate a rich set of walking and jumping motions on a real quadruped robot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9562022/
