Zero Step Capturability for Legged Robots in Multicontact,"The ability to anticipate a fall is fundamental for any robot that has to balance. Currently, fast fall-prediction algorithms only exist for simple models, such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM), whose validity breaks down in multicontact scenarios (i.e., when contacts are not limited to a flat ground). This paper presents a fast fall-prediction algorithm based on the point-mass model, which remains valid in multicontact scenarios. The key assumption of our algorithm is that, in order to come to a stop without changing its contacts, a robot only needs to accelerate its center of mass in the direction opposite to its velocity. This assumption allows us to predict the fall by means of a convex optimal control problem, which we solve with a fast custom algorithm (less than 11 ms of computation time). We validated the approach through extensive simulations with the humanoid robot HRP-2 in randomly-sampled scenarios. Comparisons with standard LIPM-based methods demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in predicting the fall of the robot, when controlled with a state-of-the-art balance controller. This paper lays the foundations for the solution of the challenging problem of push recovery in multicontact scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8383993/
Benchmarking Agility For Multilegged Terrestrial Robots,"In this paper, we present a novel and practical approach for benchmarking agility. We focus on terrestrial, multilegged locomotion in the field of bio-inspired robotics. We define agility as the ability to perform a set of different but specific tasks executed in a fast and efficient manner. This definition is inspired by the analysis of natural role models, such as dogs and horses as well as robotic systems. An evaluation of existing benchmarks in robotics is done and taken into account in our proposed benchmark. After the general definition, the actual normalized benchmarking values are defined, and measuring methods, as well as an online database for agility score collection and distribution, are presented. To provide a baseline for agile locomotion, various videos of dog-agility competitions were analyzed and agility scores calculated wherever applicable. Finally, validation and implementation of the benchmark are done with different robots directly available to the authors. In conclusion, our benchmark will enable researchers not only to compare existing robots and find out strengths and weaknesses in different design approaches, but also give a tool to define new fitness functions for optimization, learning processes, and future robots developments, intensifying the links between biology and technology even further.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8610238/
C-CROC: Continuous and Convex Resolution of Centroidal Dynamic Trajectories for Legged Robots in Multicontact Scenarios,"Synthesizing legged locomotion requires planning one or several steps ahead (literally): when and where, and with which effector should the next contact(s) be created between the robot and the environment? Validating a contact candidate implies a minima the resolution of a slow, nonlinear optimization problem, to demonstrate that a center of mass (CoM) trajectory, compatible with the contact transition constraints, exists. We propose a conservative reformulation of this trajectory generation problem as a convex 3-D linear program, named convex resolution of centroidal dynamic trajectories (CROC). It results from the observation that if the CoM trajectory is a polynomial with only one free variable coefficient, the nonlinearity of the problem disappears. This has two consequences. On the positive side, in terms of computation times, CROC outperforms the state of the art by at least one order of magnitude, and allows to consider interactive applications (with a planning time roughly equal to the motion time). On the negative side, in our experiments, our approach finds a majority of the feasible trajectories found by a nonlinear solver, but not all of them. Still, we demonstrate that the solution space covered by CROC is large enough to achieve the automated planning of a large variety of locomotion tasks for different robots, demonstrated in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot, several of which were rarely seen before. Another significant contribution is the introduction of a Bezier curve representation of the problem, which guarantees that the constraints of the CoM trajectory are verified continuously, and not only at discrete points as traditionally done. This formulation is lossless, and results in more robust trajectories. It is not restricted to CROC, but could rather be integrated with any method from the state of the art.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972482/
A Motion Planning Approach for Nonprehensile Manipulation and Locomotion Tasks of a Legged Robot,"Nonprehensile manipulation produces underconstraint motions that are sensitive to environmental dynamics. Legged locomotion constitutes a floating-based movement, whose dynamic is underactuated with respect to the inertial frame. When these two tasks are combined, system motion planning and control are complex due to their inherent underactuated features. This article presents a motion planning framework for a legged robot that uses its limbs for nonprehensile manipulation, as well as locomoting motions. First, issues related to the description of the robot-object-environment system and the task are presented. The velocity constraint that prevents separation and the force constraint that restricts interactive forces are then integrated into the system dynamic model to produce bounds on the system acceleration as a function of the system state. Then, we solve the motion planning problem by reducing the system dimensions in operational space and programming feasible trajectories within the phase plane. This approach is employed to control the quadruped robot TITAN-VIII to manipulate objects and locomote itself using Drive Mode, Inchworm Mode, Scoot Mode, and Throw Mode. Experimental results obtained through simulations and physical tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8979158/
Navigation for Legged Mobility: Dynamic Climbing,"Autonomous navigation through unstructured terrains has been most effectively demonstrated by animals, who utilize a large set of locomotive styles to move through their native habitats. While legged robots have recently demonstrated several of these locomotion modalities (such as walking, running, jumping, and climbing vertical walls), motion planners have yet to be able to leverage these unique mobility characteristics. In this article, we outline some of the specific motion planning challenges faced when attempting to plan for legged systems with dynamic gaits, with specific instances of these demonstrated by the dynamic climbing platform TAILS. Using a unique implementation of sampling-based model predictive optimization, we demonstrate the ability to motion plan around obstacles on vertical walls and experimentally demonstrate this on TAILS by navigating through traditionally difficult narrow gap problems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946895/
Tactile Sensing and Terrain-Based Gait Control for Small Legged Robots,"For small legged robots, ground contact interactions significantly affect the dynamics and locomotion performance. In this article, we designed thin, robust capacitive tactile sensors and applied them to the feet of a small hexapod with C-shaped rotating legs. The sensors measure contact forces as the robot traverses different types of terrain including hard surfaces with high or low friction, sand, and grass. Different gaits perform best on different types of terrain. Useful measured parameters include the magnitude and timing of the peak normal forces, in combination with the leg rotational velocity. The measured parameters were used in a support vector machine classifier to identify terrain types with 82.5% accuracy. Based on gait performance studies, we implemented a terrain-based gait control using real-time terrain classifications. A surface transitioning test shows 17.1% increase in body speed and 13.2% improvement in efficiency as the robot adjusts its gait.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8823987/
