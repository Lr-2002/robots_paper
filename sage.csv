 Towards versatile legged robots through active impedance control,2015,"time is a fundamental building block towards versatility. Experiments with our 80?kg hydraulic quadruped robot HyQ demonstrate that active impedance alone (i.e. no springs in the structure) can successfully emulate passively compliant elements during highly dynamic locomotion tasks (running, jumping and hopping); and that no springs are needed to protect the actuation system. Here we present results of a flying trot, also referred to as a running trot. To the best of the authors? knowledge this is the first time a flying trot has been successfully implemented on a robot without passive elements such as springs. A critical discussion on the pros and cons of active impedance concludes the paper.

legged walking robot in unknown rough terrain,2012,"global matching (SGM) method. Further, a visual odometry is calculated along with an error measure. Pose estimates are obtained by fusing inertial data with relative leg odometry and visual odometry measurements using an indirect information filter. The visual odometry error measure is used in the filtering process to put lower weights on erroneous visual odometry data, hence, improving the robustness of pose estimation. From the estimated poses and the depth images, a dense digital terrain map is created by applying the locus method. The traversability of the terrain is estimated by a plane fitting approach and paths are planned using a D* Lite planner taking the traversability of the terrain and the current motion capabilities of the robot into account. Motion commands and the traversability measures of the upcoming terrain are sent to the walking layer of the robot so that it can choose an appropriate gait for the terrain.

For example, given a desired locomotion behavior, we can guarantee the minimization of contact forces to reduce slipping on difficult terrains while ensuring high tracking performance of the desired motion.

From an acceptable deterministic model, a stochastic one is generated, capable of capturing and reproducing uncertain system?environment interactions at given levels of fidelity. The reported approach combines methodological elements from probabilistic model validation and randomized algorithms, to simultaneously quantify the fidelity of a model and tune the distribution of random parameters in the corresponding stochastic extension, in order to reproduce the variability observed experimentally in the physical process of interest. The approach can be applied to an array of physical processes, the models of which may come in different forms, including differential equations; we demonstrate this point by considering examples from the areas of miniature legged robots and aerial vehicles.", 10.1177/0278364915576336
II                 for Reversible Switch between Walk and Roll on Demand,2009,"type locomotion, particularly in a transitional state of sitting or standing, we propose a control method based on minimization of the total energy cost using the distribution of the motor power payload in the hip and knee joints, in addition to the method of keeping the same payload factor. Also, we discuss robot configurations for switching between the two locomotion types by considering environmental factors such as walking gaits, ground inclination angle and robot?s traveling direction. Knee joint position of a pivotal foot determines knee ahead and knee behind gaits. In each switch, we check such characteristics as the hip joint rotation direction, robot center trajectory, and necessary total power in a practical point of use. Then we build three beneficial switching cycles aiming for moderate use of a motor, rider?s comfort, and power saving. Finally, we demonstrate the switching by considering the aim and verify that the results of the analysis become useful for enabling switching on demand.", 10.1177/0278364909348762

"stabilized quadrupedal bounding, pacing, pronking, and trotting",2018," This paper applies an extension of classical averaging methods to hybrid dynamical systems, thereby achieving formally specified, physically effective and robust instances of all virtual bipedal gaits on a quadrupedal robot. Gait specification takes the form of a three parameter family of coupling rules mathematically shown to stabilize limit cycles in a low degree of freedom template: an abstracted pair of vertical hoppers whose relative phase locking encodes the desired physical leg patterns. These coupling rules produce the desired gaits when appropriately applied to the physical robot. The formal analysis reveals a distinct set of morphological regimes determined by the distribution of the body?s inertia within which particular phase relationships are naturally locked with no need for feedback stabilization (or, if undesired, must be countermanded by the appropriate feedback), and these regimes are shown empirically to analogously govern the physical machine as well. In addition to the mathematical stability analysis and data from physical experiments we summarize a number of extensive numerical studies that explore the relationship between the simple template and its more complicated anchoring body models.", 10.1177/0278364918779874

The resulting vector field planner guarantees convergence to an arbitrarily specified goal, avoiding collisions along the way with fixed but arbitrarily placed instances from the catalog as well as completely unknown fixed obstacles so long as they are strongly convex and well separated.

" That Which Does Not Stabilize, Will Only Make Us Stronger",2007," Many places in the world are too rugged or enclosed for vehicles to access. Even today, material transport to such areas is limited to manual labor and beasts of burden. Modern advancements in wearable robotics may make those methods obsolete. Lower extremity exoskeletons seek to supplement the intelligence and sensory systems of a human with the significant strength and endurance of a pair of wearable robotic legs that support a payload. This article first outlines the use of Clinical Gait Analysis data as the framework for the design of such a system at UC Berkeley. This data is used to design the exoskeleton degrees of freedom and size its actuators. It will then give an overview of one of the control schemes implemented on the BLEEX. The control algorithm described here increases the system closed loop sensitivity to its wearer?s forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The control algorithm uses the inverse dynamics of the exoskeleton, scaled by a number smaller than unity, as a positive feedback controller. This controller almost destabilizes the system since it leads to an overall loop gain slightly smaller than unity and results in a large sensitivity to all wearer?s forces and torques thereby allowing the exoskeleton to shadow its wearer.", 10.1177/0278364907074472

 Adaptive Dynamic Walking of a Quadruped Robot on Natural Ground Based on Biological Concepts,2007,"contained quadruped (called Tekken2) walk on natural ground, several new reflexes and responses are developed in addition to those developed in previous studies. A flexor reflex prevents a leg from stumbling on small bumps and pebbles. A sideways stepping reflex stabilizes rolling motion on a sideways inclined slope. A corrective stepping reflex/response prevents the robot from falling down in the case of loss of ground contact. A crossed flexor reflex helps a swinging leg keep enough clearance between the toe and the ground. The effectiveness of the proposed neural system model control and especially the newly developed reflexes and responses are validated by indoor and outdoor experiments using Tekken2. A CPG receives sensory feedback as a result of motions induced by reflexes, and changes the period of its own active phase. Since a CPG has the ability of mutual entrainment with pitching motion of legs and rolling motion of the body in addition, the consistency between motion of a leg temporally modified by a reflex and motions of the other legs is maintained autonomously. It is shown that CPGs can be the center of sensorimotor coordination, and that the neural system model simply defining the relationships between CPGs, sensory input, reflexes and mechanical system works very well even in complicated tasks such as adaptive dynamic walking on unstructured natural ground.", 10.1177/0278364907078089

 Quantitative measures of a robot’s physical ability to balance,2016," This paper presents quantitative measures of a robot?s physical ability to balance itself actively on a single point, line or area of support. These measures express the ratio of a change in the state of motion of the robot?s center of mass to the amount of action required at the actuated joints in order to produce that change. They therefore represent measures of the gain of the robot mechanism as seen from the point of view of the balance control system. This paper is concerned mainly with ratios of velocities, called velocity gains, and it builds on earlier work by showing how these ratios can be defined and calculated for the case of a general planar or spatial robot balancing on a point, line or general rolling contact, or an area contact with a compliant surface. The paper concludes with three examples of use?design of a triple pendulum, analysis of a hydraulic quadruped, and expressing the physics of planar balancing?followed by a short discussion of gyroscopic balancing.", 10.1177/0278364916669599

Moreover, in the absence of an existing ancillary controller, our method can be used to train a parametrized importance sampling policy using data from the stochastic rollouts. The algorithm may thereby bootstrap itself by learning an importance sampling policy offline and then refining it to unseen environments during online control. We validate our results on three robotic systems, including hardware experiments on a quadrupedal robot.", 10.1177/02783649211047890

 Dynamic Rolling for a Modular Loop Robot,2009,"based feedback controller to achieve dynamic rolling for a loop robot. The robot senses its position relative to the ground and changes its shape as it rolls. This shape is such that its center of gravity is maintained to be in front of its contact point with the ground, so in effect the robot is continuously falling and thus accelerates forward. Using simulation and experimental results, we show how the desired shape can be varied to achieve higher terminal velocities. The highest velocity achieved in this work is 26 module lengths per second (1.6 m/s) which is believed to be the fastest gait yet implemented for an untethered modular robot. One of the major findings is that more elongated shapes achieve higher terminal velocities than rounder shapes. We demonstrate that this trend holds going up inclines as well as down. We show that rounder shapes have lower specific resistance and are thus more energy efficient. The control scheme is scalable to an arbitrary number of modules, shown here using eight to 14 modules.", 10.1177/0278364908099463

 Visual Servoing for Nonholonomically Constrained Three Degree of Freedom Kinematic Systems,2007," This paper addresses problems of robot navigation with nonholonomic motion constraints and perceptual cues arising from onboard visual servoing in partially engineered environments. A general hybrid procedure is proposed that adapts to the constrained motion setting the standard feedback controller arising from a navigation function in the fully actuated case. This is accomplished by switching back and forth between moving ?down? and ?across? the associated gradient field toward the stable manifold it induces in the constrained dynamics. Guaranteed to avoid obstacles in all cases, conditions are provided under which the new procedure brings initial configurations to within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the goal.Simulation results are given for a sample of visual servoing problems with a few different perceptual models. The empirical effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is documented by reporting results of its application to outdoor autonomous visual registration experiments with the robot RHex guided by engineered beacons.", 10.1177/0278364907080737

Zero Step Capturability for Legged Robots in Multicontact,"The ability to anticipate a fall is fundamental for any robot that has to balance. Currently, fast fall-prediction algorithms only exist for simple models, such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM), whose validity breaks down in multicontact scenarios (i.e., when contacts are not limited to a flat ground). This paper presents a fast fall-prediction algorithm based on the point-mass model, which remains valid in multicontact scenarios. The key assumption of our algorithm is that, in order to come to a stop without changing its contacts, a robot only needs to accelerate its center of mass in the direction opposite to its velocity. This assumption allows us to predict the fall by means of a convex optimal control problem, which we solve with a fast custom algorithm (less than 11 ms of computation time). We validated the approach through extensive simulations with the humanoid robot HRP-2 in randomly-sampled scenarios. Comparisons with standard LIPM-based methods demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in predicting the fall of the robot, when controlled with a state-of-the-art balance controller. This paper lays the foundations for the solution of the challenging problem of push recovery in multicontact scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8383993/,
Benchmarking Agility For Multilegged Terrestrial Robots,"In this paper, we present a novel and practical approach for benchmarking agility. We focus on terrestrial, multilegged locomotion in the field of bio-inspired robotics. We define agility as the ability to perform a set of different but specific tasks executed in a fast and efficient manner. This definition is inspired by the analysis of natural role models, such as dogs and horses as well as robotic systems. An evaluation of existing benchmarks in robotics is done and taken into account in our proposed benchmark. After the general definition, the actual normalized benchmarking values are defined, and measuring methods, as well as an online database for agility score collection and distribution, are presented. To provide a baseline for agile locomotion, various videos of dog-agility competitions were analyzed and agility scores calculated wherever applicable. Finally, validation and implementation of the benchmark are done with different robots directly available to the authors. In conclusion, our benchmark will enable researchers not only to compare existing robots and find out strengths and weaknesses in different design approaches, but also give a tool to define new fitness functions for optimization, learning processes, and future robots developments, intensifying the links between biology and technology even further.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8610238/,
C-CROC: Continuous and Convex Resolution of Centroidal Dynamic Trajectories for Legged Robots in Multicontact Scenarios,"Synthesizing legged locomotion requires planning one or several steps ahead (literally): when and where, and with which effector should the next contact(s) be created between the robot and the environment? Validating a contact candidate implies a minima the resolution of a slow, nonlinear optimization problem, to demonstrate that a center of mass (CoM) trajectory, compatible with the contact transition constraints, exists. We propose a conservative reformulation of this trajectory generation problem as a convex 3-D linear program, named convex resolution of centroidal dynamic trajectories (CROC). It results from the observation that if the CoM trajectory is a polynomial with only one free variable coefficient, the nonlinearity of the problem disappears. This has two consequences. On the positive side, in terms of computation times, CROC outperforms the state of the art by at least one order of magnitude, and allows to consider interactive applications (with a planning time roughly equal to the motion time). On the negative side, in our experiments, our approach finds a majority of the feasible trajectories found by a nonlinear solver, but not all of them. Still, we demonstrate that the solution space covered by CROC is large enough to achieve the automated planning of a large variety of locomotion tasks for different robots, demonstrated in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot, several of which were rarely seen before. Another significant contribution is the introduction of a Bezier curve representation of the problem, which guarantees that the constraints of the CoM trajectory are verified continuously, and not only at discrete points as traditionally done. This formulation is lossless, and results in more robust trajectories. It is not restricted to CROC, but could rather be integrated with any method from the state of the art.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972482/,
A Motion Planning Approach for Nonprehensile Manipulation and Locomotion Tasks of a Legged Robot,"Nonprehensile manipulation produces underconstraint motions that are sensitive to environmental dynamics. Legged locomotion constitutes a floating-based movement, whose dynamic is underactuated with respect to the inertial frame. When these two tasks are combined, system motion planning and control are complex due to their inherent underactuated features. This article presents a motion planning framework for a legged robot that uses its limbs for nonprehensile manipulation, as well as locomoting motions. First, issues related to the description of the robot-object-environment system and the task are presented. The velocity constraint that prevents separation and the force constraint that restricts interactive forces are then integrated into the system dynamic model to produce bounds on the system acceleration as a function of the system state. Then, we solve the motion planning problem by reducing the system dimensions in operational space and programming feasible trajectories within the phase plane. This approach is employed to control the quadruped robot TITAN-VIII to manipulate objects and locomote itself using Drive Mode, Inchworm Mode, Scoot Mode, and Throw Mode. Experimental results obtained through simulations and physical tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8979158/,
Navigation for Legged Mobility: Dynamic Climbing,"Autonomous navigation through unstructured terrains has been most effectively demonstrated by animals, who utilize a large set of locomotive styles to move through their native habitats. While legged robots have recently demonstrated several of these locomotion modalities (such as walking, running, jumping, and climbing vertical walls), motion planners have yet to be able to leverage these unique mobility characteristics. In this article, we outline some of the specific motion planning challenges faced when attempting to plan for legged systems with dynamic gaits, with specific instances of these demonstrated by the dynamic climbing platform TAILS. Using a unique implementation of sampling-based model predictive optimization, we demonstrate the ability to motion plan around obstacles on vertical walls and experimentally demonstrate this on TAILS by navigating through traditionally difficult narrow gap problems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946895/,
Tactile Sensing and Terrain-Based Gait Control for Small Legged Robots,"For small legged robots, ground contact interactions significantly affect the dynamics and locomotion performance. In this article, we designed thin, robust capacitive tactile sensors and applied them to the feet of a small hexapod with C-shaped rotating legs. The sensors measure contact forces as the robot traverses different types of terrain including hard surfaces with high or low friction, sand, and grass. Different gaits perform best on different types of terrain. Useful measured parameters include the magnitude and timing of the peak normal forces, in combination with the leg rotational velocity. The measured parameters were used in a support vector machine classifier to identify terrain types with 82.5% accuracy. Based on gait performance studies, we implemented a terrain-based gait control using real-time terrain classifications. A surface transitioning test shows 17.1% increase in body speed and 13.2% improvement in efficiency as the robot adjusts its gait.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8823987/,
